              Our friends at the Children's Museum of South Carolina in Myrtle
              Beach have heard that the Hubble Space Telescope can look back in
              time, and they wonder how that's possible.

              Well, here's something to think about. When you hear a plane, do
              you ever have trouble spotting it in the sky? If you look up where
              the sound seems to be coming from, the plane is no longer there.
              That is because it takes time for the sound waves to reach you,
              and by the time they do, the plane has moved on. So, in a sense,
              you are "hearing back in time," because the sound you hear is the
              sound of the plane several seconds ago, not the sound of the plane
              now. When you do spot the plane, you are actually seeing it as it
              was a tiny fraction of a second ago because just as sound waves
              take time to travel, so do light waves. Now, nothing can travel
              faster than light, but as fast as it is, light still needs time to
              get anywhere, whether it's across a room, across the span of
              atmosphere beneath an airplane, or across a big part of the
              universe.

              farther away an object is, the longer its light takes to reach us.
              When you look across the room, you see something as it was a few
              billionths of a second ago, and when you look at the moon, you see
              the light that left it a little more than 1 second ago. If our
              star, the Sun, were to suddenly burn out, we wouldn't even know it
              for more than 8 minutes,because the last bit of light that left it
              would take that long to travel to Earth! Don't worry, though. The
              Sun is going to last for another 5 billion years or so! But what
              about all the more distant stars? It takes much longer for their
              light to reach us. When you look at the stars at night, you are
              seeing light that may have taken 20 or 30 or even a few hundred
              years to reach your eyes. You are looking back in time. The
              distances in the universe are so vast that scientists use the term
              "light year" to measure them. A light year is the distance light
              travels in one year, or 10 trillion kilometers. That's 1 followed
              by 13 zeros!

              Galaxy that is 30 million light years away. The Hubble Space
              Telescope can see objects even more distant than your eyes can.
              When it takes a picture of a galaxy 100 million light years away,
              we are seeing the galaxy as it looked 100 million years ago. At
              the time that light left that galaxy, dinosaurs still roamed Earth
              and humans would not appear for many millions of years!Because
              distant galaxies appear to us as they were millions or even
              billions of years ago, we can study how they change over time. By
              looking at distant galaxies, we see what they looked like when the
              universe was much younger, as galaxies were first forming. As we
              look at closer and closer galaxies we see how they change as they
              age, just as looking at babies, children, teenagers, and then
              adults can show how we humans change as we age.
